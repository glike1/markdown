Hello everyone,today i would like to talk about my favourite frontier technology---Image de-raindrop algorithm.

In the process of image processing,we will encounter all kinds of noise, such as in the night scene photos will have a lot of noise, in the haze weather will be hazy, in rainy days there will be dense raindrops... So removing all kinds of noise in the image, restore the clear image is also a major research direction in the field of CV. 

The first method is to use attention against the network to remove rain from a single image.

This method is from this year's CVPR article"Attentive Generative Adversarial Network for Raindrop Removal from a Single Image", a research result of Peking University, National University of Singapore, and Yale-National University of Singapore. It mainly removes water droplets on car windows.

Due to the influence of various factors, the problem of rain removal is actually a very complicated problem. First of all, this problem is how to model. The basic idea is to decompose the rain image into an image without raindrops and an image affected by raindrops.

We use the GAN framework to solve this problem. The innovation lies in the introduction of a visual attention mechanism in the generator and discriminator, so that the model can be aware of which places are affected by rain.

The first part is the generator.
The generator consists of two parts, one is based on the recurrent neural network to generate the attention heat map, and the other is the contextual autoencoder, which is used to generate the image after the rain.

The second part is the discriminator.
The discriminator is to distinguish who is true and who is false. The image can be judged from both global and local aspects. From a local perspective, it is necessary to check the parts that may be false, but there is no prior information. To tell us which positions may be false, so the discriminator needs to learn by itself.

There are also many applications for removing raindrops from images. For example, if the vehicle is to drive automatically, it is necessary to maintain a good and clean field of vision. For example, it is necessary to process the monitoring images of roads in rainy days and some machines that need to work in the rain. Although this is only a small branch in the field of CV, it is also an important scientific and technological force that can benefit our mankind.
